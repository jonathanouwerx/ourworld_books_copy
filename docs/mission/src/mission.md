**"When you were born in a world where you don’t fit in, you were born to help create a new one."**

Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets.

An Internet of Internets is owned by the people

It interconnects us all, directly, without anyone in the middle

We store our data in full sovereignty and privacy

On top of it, we build valuable experiences, useful experiences

Not to control. Not to addict. Not to manipulate.

Rather to connect. To exchange. To share. To provide value for each other

A circular economy, to benefit the collective and, as a result, each of us individually

As believers in a better world who choose to act.

**"The fight for a better Internet is inseparable from the fight for a better world."**

We can continue down the path we’re on.

But ask yourself, is it a good one? Is it the right one? Is it just?

Is the world we live in today the one we wish for our children and all those to come?

If yes, please continue.

If not, we have an answer.

Come on, come all. Creators. Builders. Dreamers. No need to dream anymore.

This is the Internet of Internets.

It’s for you. For me. For all of us.

By you. By me. By all of us.

So, are you with us? Then come along.

Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets.

Planet First

Profit As Result

Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.

Of course being financially healthy is requirement nr 1.

We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. 

ThreeFold is a movement, not just a project or company. 


together we are creating the Internet of Internets 

abundance based, unlimited knowledge, communication, global collaboration
exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries.

# **THREEFOLD 5 STRATEGIC GOALS**

# ![image alt text](img/image_2.png)

## **Goal 1: Realize the Internet of Internets Concept**

OurWorld Internet of Internets, is not one Internet as owned by the very few. It's thousands of interconnected Internets, where each Internet is founded and grown by a local community. You become The Internet.

OurWorld Internet of Internets is our chance to create a beautiful digital world in which we are free and powerful, a world where we can co-create a better future for everyone. We need to say NO to being a product of the large centralized corporations. We need to free ourselves, even from our own brainwashing.

We need a system where we:

* can be free and independent yet fully interconnected over all OurWorld Internet of Internets

* learn and play, grow in awareness and learn from each other

* don’t have to be afraid of an uncertain future where the privileged few define the next steps

* don’t become addicted to the biggest potential drug called money 
(money is not bad, money can be beautiful, money should be an energy source for change)

* protect the beautiful planet we live on

Read more about this in:

* OurWorld Abundance System		[http://abundance.ourworld.tf](http://abundance.ourworld.tf) 

* OurWorld Experiences			[http://experiences.ourworld.tf](http://experiences.ourworld.tf) 

**Next steps:**

Together with our community we want to create an OurWorld Creator Zone in Zanzibar. This zone will be a sandbox from which the OurWorld vision can be created and implemented in Zanzibar first with full support of the local government and community. As a side effect our community will demonstrate how a healthy and fun lifestyle can be the foundation for amazing passion, creativity and productivity.

## **Goal 2: Help Countries to make their Internet GDP Positive.**

Many countries don’t have an internet, they have a long cable to the Internet, this leads to loss in money, data, security, and human resources. It's our aim to support countries in building their Internet and provide economic chances to the ones who have a difficult time catching up in this hectic world.

Key Words

* Sovereignty

* Security

* Flexibility

* Cost

Today most countries lose money because of the Internet, e.g. their citizens using services outside of their country, having to pay a lot for expensive Internet backbone (fiber) services, monetization of citizens data, …

Together with our friends we are talking to some countries who are very open about the possibilities of a sovereign country cloud.

## **Goal 3: Realizing Web 4 for a better world.**

There are thousands of wonderful projects out there which want to provide value for the world but they miss a framework which helps them in achieving their goals.

**_""”The industry is talented in creating solutions to problems that should have never been there.”””_**

Much of the current Cloud & Blockchain Industry is way too complicated and fragmented for what they need. 

To build something today you need 10+ different systems and integrate them all. Many believe that an ecosystem of different solutions can be stitched together to create something bigger. History has already shown that this is not the case. We call this the ‘Onion Problem’ (more about this in a document I still have to write), but basically it means that systems get so complicated that people don’t dare to change anything inside so everyone keeps on creating other layers on top of the layers which already exist, this lead to even more complicated systems which no-one seems to fully understand and allowing hackers to have a great time because there are hundreds of places to find vulnerabilities in. Blockchain did not make things easier, it became even more difficult and non transparent.

It's difficult for projects to build a system which allows them to scale and work easily with their communities. The systems today are simply too complicated and unsafe (think about current wallets, exchanges, …)


The current way how the internet is created is just wrong, client - server is simply wrong, the fact that we exist 100 times on the internet is wrong, we need Web 4.0 We should not spend any time on anything which is not to the benefit of our Vision and The Planet

Benevolent projects need 

* A trust based system, where people can be themselves and communicate with each other and the project in a safe container with full identity and transparency.

* A financial (funding & exchange) system which is safe, fast, reliable and easy to use for everyone.

* An application and development platform which allows them to build their "experience" in the fastest possible way with less complexity and no need to re-invent everything (like is the case now).

* A storage system where all data & information is stored by the user and owned by the user. An ultra reliable system which can never lose data and which scales to a planetary scale.

* An easy system so that less technical people can also use it.

* A system which is cost effective, we know projects who went bankrupt by doing good because they could not afford existing centralized cloud systems.

* A system which keeps the data in the country where the people live, this leads to more performance and safety.

## **Goal 5: Make ThreeFold the most useful Internet Infrastructure in the world.**

Every day farmers are adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid, we are growing quite well organically. There is a booster to let this happen faster, that's by means of our neighborhood cloud initiative also called INCA.

A neighborhood cloud is like a community driven decentralized data center. The initiative provides residents, businesses, developers and the government in your city with a secure and highly available sovereign cloud infrastructure to store and process their data locally.  ThreeFold works with Real Estate developers to deploy a large amount of Internet capacity in their projects, which is a win-win situation for the developer, the home owner and ThreeFold.

A first project in Dubai for 170 Villa’s has been realized and there is now a funnel of at least 10 more. Each project brings Internet capacity to the local community which is the easiest way to expand the ThreeFold Grid.

Next to our Neighborhood Cloud expansion model, we support our global Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and commercial farmers. 

A 2e large neighborhood cloud is very close to being signed, this time with even more homes.
