#### Population density {#population-density}

Decentralised internet deployments follow population distribution. Denser areas require more local capacity (more and larger deployments) while less densely populated areas can have sparser (and smaller deployments).  For the technical design of capacity instances and sizing  population demographics are key drivers.
