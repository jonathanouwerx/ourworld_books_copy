If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that digital is a necessity. It guarantees the continuity of services in the event of a crisis, and is also essential for ensuring a country’s competitiveness and growth.

To initiate Tanzania’s digital transformation and ensure the social, financial and digital inclusion of all its citizens, the country needs to embark on a digitisation strategy focussed on two core areas

**Digital sovereignty and Unlocking of the Internet Economy**

A sustainable digital transformation can only be achieved if it is founded on digital sovereignty, which is the primary reason for the PPP between the Tanzanian public sector, private sector and Threefold Foundation to establish a sovereign internet infrastructure.  This strategic critical infrastructure ensures Tanzania's digital sovereignty and, more generally, the successful digitalisation of the economy and unlocking of the internet economy.

Three initiatives will spearhead the realisation of Tanzania Digital Sovereignty and the unlocking of its Internet Economy
